# Rydberg-levels-calculation-and-their-graphs
In this study, we created a Python tool to determine atom energies and quantum defects. Additionally, the program creates a graphic of the energy levels of Rydberg atoms. The program makes use of a NIST database of atoms that have energy from the first four levels. The program gives the user the choice between two options: select 1 to generate see the energy level diagram; or select 2 to compute energy and quantum defects. For atoms not included in the database, the program may nonetheless calculate Rydberg energies. The program needs some starting information to compute the energy of such atoms.
